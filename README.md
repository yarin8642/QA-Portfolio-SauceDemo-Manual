## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete manual QA testing cycle performed on the SauceDemo web application.

## What Was Done

- Created a Software Test Plan (STP)
- Designed structured Test Cases (STD)

## Test Coverage

The following areas were tested:

- Login / Logout functionality  
- Product listing and navigation  
- Cart behavior  
- Checkout process  
- Basic input validation  

Total Test Cases Executed: 10

## Environment

- OS: Windows 11  
- Browser: Google Chrome (latest version)  
- Application: https://www.saucedemo.com

## Repository Structure

- `/docs` → STP, STD, STR  
- `/test-cases` → Test case design  
- `test-execution.csv` → Execution results

This project reflects a structured manual testing process similar to a small QA cycle in a real-world environment.
